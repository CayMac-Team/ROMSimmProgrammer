These are the 3D printer STL files for the programmer.

You have a bottom piece, a switch cover piece and 2 versions of the top.
1. No cutout for the programming pin header
2. With cutout for the programming pin header

Most will need the cutout version as the pins are a bit high.
You could remove the pins or cut them down shorter as you will not need themn again.
